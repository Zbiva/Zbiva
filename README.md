##Zbiva
Zbiva is an archaeological database for eastern Alps and its surrounding regions in the early Middle Ages. According to the area, it covers the sites in Slovenia, Austria, on the NW Croatian coast, and in the NE regions in Italy, which are sometimes compared to sporadic sites from the neighbouring areas and previous era.

It consists of three large parts (which together form a concise unit):
- Sites database
- Graves database
- Artefacts (goods) database

The test version provides site data with the literature concerning each site (accessible by click in the field "Literature"), based on Libera, a database for literature on early Middle Ages.

####Installation:

You can install this app just like any other arches app; it is a modified version of the HIP app used for historicplacesla.org.  Begin by following the normal Arches HIP installation [instructions](http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/#installating-arches-hip).  At step #5, where you must create a new app, clone this repository instead, using the following command (you may need to install git first):

        git clone https://github.com/bojankastelic/zbiva.git

Now continue with the installation instructions, substituting `zbiva` for `my_hip_app` wherever the latter occurs, because "zbiva" is now the name of your app.
